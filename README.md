# CodingChallenge
Given an input file in CSV format containing list of taps (ON and OFF) in separate lines, you will need to create
an output file containing trips made by customers

Assumptions made:

Input file has all data and well formed
Max Travel hour is 4 hour per trip, if more than 4hour, then invalid
If only tap OFF record exists without tap ON record, the status is Incomplete and no charge


Input file is taps.csv
Output file is Trips.csv

## Running the Main Program

This Java project includes a main program which takes the taps.csv as input
MainApplication.java
